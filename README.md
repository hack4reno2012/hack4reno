### Sunday - December 2nd

Snacks, water, caffeine (red bull, sodas, coffee) will be available thanks to sponsorship from Cloudsnap and Noble Studios but plan ahead and bring some things.

The hackathon is 24 hours long but you can come and go as you please from the event.

PARKING
-------
Parking is free for all as it is the university and we do not have parking permits. Please keep in mind it will be a game day so coming/going around the time of the game will be difficult.

TEAM MATCHMAKING
----------------
If you do not have a team, you can try to form teams between 10am and Noon. At noon, we will help you to find a team if you do not yet have one.

SPECTATORS
----------
If you have signed up to spectate, you're welcome to come by the event at any time to see how things are progressing or come on down and work on other projects. If you signed up to spectate but think you could participate (not all the participants need to be develoepers as there is plenty of research, data cleaning, etc to be done in some teams), please let us know at colin@renocollective.com

If you want to see what comes from Hack4Reno this year, the best way to do so is to attend the Demo Presentations at 1pm.

DEMO PRESENTATIONS
------------------
At noon on Sunday, we'll call the hackathon to a close. At this time, lunch will be available and you will have an hour to prepare a demo of sorts. Do not wait until this time to think of a demo! It always helps in hackathons to think about what you'd like to demo and work backwards from that to decide what you should build.

SPONSORS
--------
This event couldn't be possible without our awesome sponsors! Each organization will be in attendance and we encourage you to meet them as they will be participating as well!
